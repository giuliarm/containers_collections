Containers/Collections Usage

To use information that comes from an API, for example, I would use the Array, making it easier to access its components by their indices. 
It could be a list of users and their information and would be useful if I needed to treat them one by one in a generic way using methods, as in the example of 'CEO's'.
As much as it is useful, the Array does not automatically evaluate your duplicates, which is the case of the Set, It eliminates duplicity, making it easier to guarantee the return of this information but not their order. 
The choice between one or the other will depend on the purpose of the program, although in my opinion the use can be complementary.
